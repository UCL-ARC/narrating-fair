# Why should we care?

## Case studies of good practices in FAIR

- Use examples relevant to your context

# Narrative CVs and FAIR

## Background

::: {.nonincremental}
- Royal Society: Resume for Researchers
-- Developed as part of the Changing Expectations programme
-- ‘standardised short format CV that emphasises the wider contributions to the research system’
-- Designed to recognise the broader contributions to the scientific endeavour

- UKRI: Résumé for Research and Innovation (R4RI)
-- Shows evidence of a wider range of skills and experience than a traditional academic CV when applying for UKRI funding opportunities.
-- Halfway between a CV and cover letter - provides the space to explain the context of your achievements.
-- In use in all funding opportunities on the UKRI Funding Service that require track record information.
