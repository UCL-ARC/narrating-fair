# Narrating FAIR: recognising and rewarding FAIR practices and the use of narrative CVs

Repository of materials for pilot workshop, to eventually include GH pages for self-use resources.

**Why this workshop:**

FAIR is used to talk about three things: data (or any digital object), metadata (information about that digital object), and infrastructure, although data is the most commonly used term. Over Â£2trillion is spent globally each year on research and development that produces a range of digital objects which are useful for further and future research. However, these are often difficult to find and reuse by people to bring continual benefits to society.

Only 28% of researchers are familiar with the principles ( 2021 State of Open Data report by Digital Science), with fewer enacting those principles. A recognised barrier to enacting FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reproducible) practices in researchers working in practices is a lack of recognition of both the researchers' efforts and the public good that is making digital objects available in a FAIR way such as:
-maximising the potential of research outputs by allowing researchers to reuse and repurpose outputs in novel and innovative ways.
- greater accessibility and transparency of the research process.
- enabling replication and verification of research findings which can also lead to more collaboration.

**Aims of the workshop are for participants to be able to:**
- Recognise benefits of FAIR practices
- Recognise FAIR on Narrative CVs
- Construct an example Narrative CV for your area demonstrating FAIR
- Express ways forward in recognising and rewarding FAIR in your context
